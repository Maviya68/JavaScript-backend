JavaScript notes : 
typeof null = object // try verifying this.
null is a standalone value ? not a type ?

2**2 means 2^2 // JavaScript

comparing values of different data types lead to inconsistent/surprising results => avoid them.
eg: (null == 0) => avoid these comparisons.

datatype verification : read Ecmascript for that.

Memory : 
Stack : primitive data types are stored here, it makes a copy when the variable is used in assignation of another variable.
Heap : non-primitive data types are stored here, when a non-primitve data type var is used in assignation of another variable it gives the same heap ref which is stored in the first variable.

Use backtick(``) string interpolation => (`-string-${var}-string-`)
