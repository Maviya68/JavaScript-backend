JavaScript notes : 
typeof null = object // try verifying this.
null is a standalone value ? not a type ?

2**2 means 2^2 // JavaScript

comparing values of different data types lead to inconsistent/surprising results => avoid them.
eg: (null == 0) => avoid these comparisons.

datatype verification : read Ecmascript for that.

Memory : 
Stack : primitive data types are stored here, it makes a copy when the variable is used in assignation of another variable.
Heap : non-primitive data types are stored here, when a non-primitve data type var is used in assignation of another variable it gives the same heap ref which is stored in the first variable.

Use backtick(``) string interpolation => (`-string-${var}-string-`)

// learn all string functions //done

* To get random integer value between a max num and min num do : 
(Math.floor(Math.random() * (max-min+1)) + min)


Dates In JS 
* In the Date(constuctor) we can also set any specific date we want.
* Various methods are given by date object to get date in different formats.
* We can customize the dates when using ToLocaleString method using its parameters. // Try it.

Arrays 
Shallow Copy => same reefernce point.
Deep Copy => different reefernce point.

slice(original array remains same) vs splice(takes the selection from the original array so it is left changed , also includes the end index which slice doesn't) 

Objects 
values of object properties can also be accessed thorugh object_name["key_in_string"]
* Adding a symbol as a key in a object also is done by defining the key as { [symbol_name] : value }
why use symbols here ?? => dont know right now.

Object.freeze(object_name) => makes all properties unchangeable in the future / constant maybe
